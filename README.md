# Exploring the Connections between India's Economic Growth, Income Inequality, and Groundwater Quality

This assignment investigated the relationship between India's economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater quality. It was completed as a part of the Econometrics course at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi.

## Description

The assignment explored the intricate connections between economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater quality in India. Data from various sources, including the National Data Analytics Platform, the Reserve Bank of India, and Mohanty et al. (2016), were analyzed. 

The dataset was transformed into a district-year level dataset, enabling the estimation of regression models to examine the relationship between economic growth, income inequality, and environmental quality, explicitly focusing on groundwater quality.

The analysis provided valuable insights into the relationship between income, inequality, and groundwater quality in India. It shed light on political intervention's importance in translating the demand for improved groundwater quality into effective policy action.

## Methodology

The following steps were taken to conduct the analysis:

1. Data Collection: Information on economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater quality was collected from reliable sources, including the National Data Analytics Platform, the Reserve Bank of India, and Mohanty et al. (2016).

2. Data Transformation: The collected data was transformed into a district-year-level dataset, ensuring compatibility for the subsequent regression analysis.

3. Regression Analysis: Regression models were estimated to analyze the relationship between economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater quality. Various statistical techniques were employed to assess the significance and strength of the connections.

4. Interpretation of Results: The regression analysis results were interpreted to gain insights into the connections between economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater quality in India.

## Findings

The analysis findings provided valuable insights into the relationship between economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater quality in India. While the specific results would depend on the dataset and the regression models employed, the analysis aimed to uncover patterns and associations that could inform policy interventions.

The analysis highlighted the importance of political intervention in addressing the issue of groundwater quality. It emphasized the need for policymakers to translate the public demand for improved groundwater quality into effective policies and regulations. The study may have identified specific factors or variables significantly associated with groundwater quality, providing potential avenues for targeted interventions.

## Conclusion

This assignment comprehensively explored the connections between India's economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater quality. By utilizing robust data and regression analysis, valuable insights were gained into the relationship between these factors.

The findings underscored the significance of political intervention and policy action in addressing the issue of groundwater quality in India. This analysis can contribute to formulating evidence-based policies and interventions that strive for sustainable economic growth, reduced income inequality, and improved groundwater quality.
